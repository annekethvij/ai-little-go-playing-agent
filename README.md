# AI Little Go Playing Agent

## Overview
This project implements an AI agent designed to play the board game Go for a 5x5 board. Drawing inspiration from Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, the agent utilizes AI search algorithms to compete against multiple agents - greedy, alpha-beta, q learner and championship players for testing and benchmarking.

## Features
- **Advanced AI Algorithms**: Incorporates AI search algorithms for decision making.
- **AlphaGo Inspiration**: Leverages concepts and strategies from the groundbreaking AlphaGo project.
